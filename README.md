# My project for testing out things

Here I am trying to make something remotely production-grade on a small scale with things I never worked before.

Currently it is using on [`sveltekit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [`pocketbase`](https://pocketbase.io/) and [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/)

If you want to run it, install packages, get pocketbase, paste contents of `pbCollectionConf.json` into PB's `Import collection` tab, enable Discord oauth in `Auth providers` tab, `npm run dev` and have fun!
