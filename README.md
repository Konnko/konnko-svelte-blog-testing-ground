# My project for testing out things

Here I am trying to make something remotely production grade on a small scale with things I have never used before.

Currently it is using [`sveltekit`](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [`pocketbase`](https://pocketbase.io/) and [`tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/)

If you want to run it, get pocketbase, paste contents of `pbCollectionConf.json` into pocketbase's `Import collection` tab, enable Discord oauth in `Auth providers` tab, create .env file, `npm run dev` and have fun!
